# Shield Defender

## Goal
The goal is gaining a score as high as possible. The ball in the middle is the hero... with a shield.  
The task is to defend against the red balls, and let the yellow balls empower the hero.  
Red balls reset the score if they hit the hero, while add +1 point if they are dodged.  
Yellow balls add +2 points if they hit the hero. No punishment is added for dodging them.

## Controls
Mouse-movement rotates the shield at the direction of the cursor.
